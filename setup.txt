make sure add corresponding .env files to Client and Server seperately


To set up the server:
make two terminals

In one: 
cd server
venv/Scripts/activate (source venv/bin/activate for Mac)
python main.py

ptr-c to leave main.py
deactivate

In other:
cd Client
npm install --save-dev vite
npm run dev
Go to local host

ctr-c to end
y



Docker: Need Docker and Docker Desktop
docker compose build --no-cache (inital build, run once probably)
docker compose up -d (runs in background)
docker compose down to stop containers

docker compose up (to see logs - helpful)
ctrl+c to stop container and ctrl+c to return to terminal

Note: Will fail to run container if mongodb connection fails
